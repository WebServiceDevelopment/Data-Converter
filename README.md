## Abstract

This is the repository for Data Converter, an application for converting EDI files formats (such as PDF and CSV) from a source format to a target format which can be read by a company's existing systems. These conversions from a source file to a target file need to be analyzed and written by a programmer, but once the transition is written, it creates a highly realiable interface where all an operator needs to do is drag and drop a file into the application in order to do the coversion.
